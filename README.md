### ℹ️ About this Kata
This Kata is about implementing a simple tennis game.
The scoring system is simple:

Each player can have either of these points in one game “love” “15” “30” “40”
- If you have 40 and you win the point you win the game, however there are special rules.
- If both have 40 the players are “deuce”.
- If the game is in deuce, the winner of a point will have advantage
- If the player with advantage wins the ball he wins the game
- If the player without advantage wins they are back at deuce.

Alternate description of the rules per Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis#Scoring ):

- A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total and at least two points more than the opponent.
- The running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from zero to three points are described as “love”, “15”, “30”, and “40” respectively.
- If at least three points have been scored by each player, and the scores are equal, the score is “deuce”.
- If at least three points have been scored by each side and a player has one more point than his opponent, the score of the game is “advantage” for the player in the lead.
